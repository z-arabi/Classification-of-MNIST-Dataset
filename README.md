# Classification-of-MNIST-Dataset

## Introduction
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

In this project, we want to classify the MNIST datasets with an MLP(Multilayer Perceptron) neural network. 

A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN).An MLP consists of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Except for the input nodes, each node is a neuron that uses a nonlinear activation function. MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable.
